[DAIL] Batch Process

DAIL batch processes and their functions:



SKILLMERGER.BAT brings files from \DAIL\ into the other folders as needed in the case of some shared 
	data that needs to be edited. if someone can suggest a better file. I will merge it in.

GQMERGE.bat run after SKILLMERGER.BAT and also AFTER you have compiled the assets in asset manager and 
	"compacted" them.  this batch file will add all the missing Titan Quest assets missing from the 
	regular DAIL folders.

XAGIT.bat = brings only the changed files from this working folder to a subfolder named XADAIL which 
	should be your git repo folder.. you can edit this if you want. just offering it for convenience. 
	you'll have to edit this heavily to make it work - if someone can suggest a better file I will merge it in
