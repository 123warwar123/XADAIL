SoT and BoC
*doors have been forcibly removed. giving multiplayer games more uptime
in the event of a lag raid death from the massive amount of spawns.

XP can be curved - monster xp was set to 25% of regular.
I've changed monster xp to 80% of regular and I've curved the xp using a
math formula so that xp is "vanilla" until level 50ish then it ramps up
quickly to 53% extra xp per level by 100
Omega updated to 0.1k
Surival mode updated to 0.41
Removed level restrictions on items and affixes
Rift/Mapping mod from WareBare has been added successfully! As a separate mod since its it's own world.

omegamod update to version J - many bugfixes and new omega bosses added as well as 3 new icons

gearing up if you just want to fight waves of monsters one after another
in the "GrimDawn: Eternal" from PrincessLuna (imho it is Princess LUA)

0009 - 10:24 PM 5/21/2016
quick fix for projectiles and other fx

0008 - 1:58 PM 5/21/2016
merged cftx ranger/necro mod
also renamed the arachnophobia mod because if it has a diff name they
wont be able to play with regular DAIL users. its just a graphical thing
so why restrict them?
cleaned up some tags and .tex files
next up: updates on necro, coronus, grimmest dawn, and any release of the rift mod will be incorporated.
maybe some initial research into cornucopia.. if it breaks vanilla chars . it might be annoying.
dont be shy about suggestions people. the way mods work for GD is annoying so we really do need these compilations ;\

0007 - 12:12 AM 5/21/2016
merged in the tt300 version of stasher mod for all our stashing needs
next up: gonna take another crack at merging the ranger / necro
masteries with coronus now that i know a bit more about .tex/etc
trickery
added an arachnophobia version too

0006 - 6:08 PM 5/20/2016
Merged in Coronus Mod
Attempted to merge Necro/Ranger/etc mod - cancelled. after unpacking it.
it was too big and contained too much stuff that seemed redundantly
stored like the base masteries. Needs more analysis
Added mod credits in the loading tips

0005-3:50 PM 5/19/2016
toned down grimmest a bit since i was having issues just wading through
on my rig (i7 5820K with 970x2) so I want to have a challenge but i also
want silky smooth 120 fps. this means i've also nerfed XP
tremendously. that is ok.
also omega mod added. works 100%

0004-3:13 PM 5/19/2016
I figured out the legendary affix stuff thanks to NateATon. I had to run
a full folder diff to find all the changes. basically the changes are
purely in the lootttable DBR files. the affix files were to increase run
speed only. and there were many global edits to items which i did not
use such as components usable in all slots.
definately level>100 is broken as heck. so i set the max level to 100
for now. maybe its ok. can i increase devotion skill levels? that
could be fun.

0003-9:50 AM 5/19/2016
elfe in http://www.grimdawn.com/forums/showthread.php?t=38578
is saying that I can go over level 100, so i set the max level back to 200 and will do more testing.
i tried looking at what he suggested, it doest seem like there are limits set. i copied the grimmest stuff
also level>100 seems to break access to the challenge areas. the doors are unresponsive.

also i wonder can i globally edit dbr files or run sql like queries
against them??? ill look into it. as it is the only way to do massive
edits like this.....

0002-2:51 AM 5/19/2016
grimmest worked. yay - but only if i set the cap to level 100.. thats not soo bad. 15 more levels ;\
still need to figure out legendary/epic affixes from NateATon's hard research and work. Thank you again senpai.

0001-2:52 PM 5/18/2016
initial version
not done *affixes will be added to epic and legendary items
done * levels will be uncapped for players and monster scaling
levels are 200 but monsters aren't spawning must merge in grimmest`
