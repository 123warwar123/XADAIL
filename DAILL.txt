*************************************************
READ THIS NOW OK DONT SKIP IT OR INSTALL WILL FAIL
****************************************
WHEN YOU ARE CHOOSING THE FOLDER MAKE SURE IT IS THE GRIM DAWN INSTALL FOLDER AND NOT THE MODS FOLDER!
THE DEFAULT FOLDER MIGHT BE ACCURATE IF YOU DID NOT CUSTOMIZE YOUR STEAM INSTALL
****************************************
Now for an explanation of the various install options:
(X)   = Hard Mode (increased xp, enemy difficulty, lower enemy population and 10-100% loot quality increase)
(S)   = S class mode - prepare for your GPU and CPU to melt. full grimmest everything.
(B)   = Medium Grimmest - this is essentially boss script upgrades and x2 heroes with regular other spawns
(NG)  = Vanilla Difficulty (No Grimmest)
(A)   = Tiny Spiders + S Mode
(AB)  = Tiny Spiders + B Mode
(AX)  = Tiny Spiders + X Mode
(ANG) = Tiny Spiders + Vanilla Mode
