tagSkillClassDescription29=The Arlequin is the great-grandfather of the Nightblades, it's said... by them. Nightblades typically pretend they don't exist to be honest - but the elegant, mystical, majestic Arlequin knows the truth of it!

The Arlequin is here to entertain, not bore you with such silly things as facts! The Arlequin lives for the show, and the show is bloody.
